Bite usage examples in Unity

The Bite Unity project is an application that will load a scene from a Asset Bundle called "mod_scene" in the "AssetBundles" Folder.

The other two unity projects are asset bundles that contain scenes that will pack different Bite code and load it through a common loader at runtime.
